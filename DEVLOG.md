# Developer Log — Agentic Runtime

## \[Day 0] — Project Initialization

* ✅ Decided to build a modular agent runtime in Rust, grounded in the Model-Context-Protocol (MCP) architecture.
* ✅ Intentionally not using LangChain or other agent wrappers; starting from first principles.
* ✅ Defined "Agent" as a composable, protocol-driven unit of autonomy.
* ✅ Committed to slow, thoughtful development in a single-threaded flow.
* ✅ Created project structure and initial trait for Agent.

## Next

* [ ] Define the `Model` abstraction (holds goal and state)
* [ ] Define the `Context` abstraction (tools, memory, llm)
* [ ] Define `Plan`, `ExecutionResult`, `SimulationResult`, `Feedback` types
* [ ] Scaffold a basic CLI entrypoint
* [ ] Wire up logging and error handling macros
