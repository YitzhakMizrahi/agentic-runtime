# Agentic Runtime

**The Linux of the Agentic Age** — a modular, secure, Rust-native runtime for building intelligent, tool-using agents that can plan, act, reflect, and adapt.

This project is a foundational stepping stone toward open, safe, and powerful agentic systems. Inspired by the idea of an "OS1" (as in *Her*), but built as a composable framework for developers.

## Goals

* ✅ Safe, pluggable tools (Git, Search, Editor, API)
* ✅ Clean planning + execution lifecycle (MCP: Model-Context-Protocol)
* ✅ Memory integration (structured + semantic)
* ✅ Language-agnostic access (via CLI, REST, FFI)
* ✅ Simulation and reflection built-in

## Why?

Because the future will run on agents — and we need a trustworthy, open foundation for them.

> Build the primitives. Compose anything.

## Project Structure

* `agent/` – Core agent trait and lifecycle
* `model/` – Agent state and domain data
* `context/` – Tools, environment, LLM access
* `protocol/` – Planning, simulation, reflection logic
* `tools/` – Executable tool interfaces (Git, Search, etc.)
* `memory/` – Memory interfaces and backends
