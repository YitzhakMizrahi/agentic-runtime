# Developer Log — Agentic Runtime

## [Day 0] — Project Initialization

* ✅ Decided to build a modular agent runtime in Rust, grounded in the Model-Context-Protocol (MCP) architecture.
* ✅ Intentionally not using LangChain or other agent wrappers; starting from first principles.
* ✅ Defined "Agent" as a composable, protocol-driven unit of autonomy.
* ✅ Committed to slow, thoughtful development in a single-threaded flow.
* ✅ Created project structure and initial trait for Agent.

## [Day 1–2] — Core Framework Bootstrapped

* ✅ Defined `Model`, `Context`, and `Tool` abstractions.
* ✅ Implemented tool execution via pluggable trait objects.
* ✅ Built `Plan`, `SimulationResult`, `ExecutionResult`, and `Feedback` structs.
* ✅ Created several tools: `FakeEchoTool`, `GitStatusTool`, `ReflectorTool`, and `LLMTool`.
* ✅ Integrated an in-memory `Memory` log system and automatic logging of tool IO.
* ✅ Implemented terminal output formatting with `colored` for better readability.
* ✅ Validated end-to-end pipeline from goal to plan → simulate → execute → feedback.
* ✅ Ensured strong pre-commit checks (format, clippy, check) for code quality.

## Next

* [ ] Refactor `Agent::plan()` to dynamically select tools from context.
* [ ] Add scoring or ranking logic to prioritize tool usage.
* [ ] Move toward multi-goal planning and hierarchical tool chaining.
* [ ] Begin experiments with live LLM-based tool selection.
* [ ] Start writing tests for individual tools and agent flow.
