# Developer Log — Agentic Runtime

## [Day 0] — Project Initialization

* ✅ Decided to build a modular agent runtime in Rust, grounded in the Model-Context-Protocol (MCP) architecture.
* ✅ Intentionally not using LangChain or other agent wrappers; starting from first principles.
* ✅ Defined "Agent" as a composable, protocol-driven unit of autonomy.
* ✅ Committed to slow, thoughtful development in a single-threaded flow.
* ✅ Created project structure and initial trait for Agent.
* ✅ Defined `Model`, `Context`, `Plan`, `SimulationResult`, `ExecutionResult`, and `Feedback` types.
* ✅ Implemented CLI-based main.rs runner.
* ✅ Added tool system: `FakeEchoTool`, `GitStatusTool`, `ReflectorTool`, `LLMTool`
* ✅ Integrated `ollama` support for local LLMs.
* ✅ Designed and enforced structured memory log with post-run reflection.
* ✅ Enabled pre-commit formatting/lint checks.
* ✅ Refactored folder structure for idiomatic modular Rust.
* ✅ Polished CLI with colored output.

## 📍 Roadmap & Milestones

### 🛠️ Phase 1 — Core Runtime (Complete)
- [x] Trait-based `Agent` lifecycle
- [x] Pluggable `Tool` trait with metadata
- [x] Basic `Context`, `Memory`, and `Model` modules
- [x] Manual tool registration
- [x] Local LLM tool using Ollama
- [x] Structured `Plan` with multi-step execution
- [x] Feedback, simulation, and memory logging

### ⚙️ Phase 2 — Developer Ergonomics (In Progress)
- [x] ✅ Color-coded CLI output
- [ ] 🔄 Hot-reloading tools or modular tool registration (`fn tools::register_all(context)`)
- [ ] 🧱 Scaffold a lightweight plugin-style tool architecture
- [ ] 🔍 Add `--dry-run`, `--plan-only`, `--interactive` flags to CLI

### 🧠 Phase 3 — Smarter Agent Capabilities (Next)
- [ ] 🧠 Introduce `Planner` abstraction (LLM-backed)
- [ ] 🗂️ Define and handle user-defined goals
- [ ] 🔄 Feedback loop that updates model/goals
- [ ] 🧠 Memory queries (`agent.context.memory().query("...")`)
- [ ] 🧩 Dynamic sub-agent spawning
- [ ] 🗃️ Workspace-aware file tools (e.g., `FileReaderTool`, `CodeSearchTool`)
- [ ] 🧠 Reflect on memory to generate new plans

### 🕸️ Phase 4 — Orchestration
- [ ] 🛠️ Tool scheduler with resource/time limits
- [ ] 🤖 Multi-agent runtime (Coordinator + Worker agents)
- [ ] 📎 Planning refinement loop (sim → revise → exec)

### 🧪 Phase 5 — UX & Observability
- [ ] 📟 REPL shell / interactive CLI
- [ ] 🌐 (Optional) Web dashboard for inspecting plans, logs, memory
- [ ] 📊 Metrics, debugging, and agent tracing
- [ ] 🧠 Persist memory state (e.g., JSON, SQLite)

## 🧠 Long-Term Vision

- 🧩 Dynamic WASM plugins for portable tools
- 🧠 Swap-in different LLMs (LLaMA, Mistral, Claude, etc.)
- 🧬 Declarative agents / config-driven behavior
- 🪟 Native OS shell extension / terminal companion
- 🧠 Meta-cognition: self-evaluation and planning refinement
- 🌱 Self-hosting: agents building agents

## 📅 Development Log

### [Day 1] — Planning Begins
- Identified current limitation: plans are static
- Goal: Add a dynamic `Planner` that can generate steps using LLMTool and memory context
- Next up: implement `Planner` abstraction and integrate it into `agent.run()`
